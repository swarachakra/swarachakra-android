=============

SoftKeyboard for Indic languages


ToDos:
*In nukta layout, tap on non-nukta keys also causes input
*In nukta layout, the last row is should be hidden
*On choosing a consonant+halant, the preview shows C+h+C for all keys including conjuncts, but not for the conjuncts in the last row.
*Same goes while applying rafar,trakar and eyelash(Marathi and Konkani)
*The 'Next' button doesnt work in SMS window.


Done:
* halant should be in the top slice of the pie (currently empty).
* Add \u0945 to the extras chakra in Hindi / Konkani / Marathi.
* * All the char+nukta in the nukta layout should be replaced by the actual nukta character.
  * In all there are 11 nukta characters.
  * \u0934(lla) can go on \u0932(la) since we dont have lla in the main layout.
